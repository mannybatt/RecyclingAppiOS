# Recycling Detection iOS App

This is the project home of a recycling app for iOS that uses the camera to scan and detect if the object in the photo is recyclable or not and displays information related to that item.
<br><br>
This was created as a possible tool for the City of Orlando to utillize in a new recycling program.
